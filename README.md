# Telecom-churn-Prediction-case-study
> In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. As a data scientist, our task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

## General Information
- Provide general information about our group project here.
- The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
  
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc

- What is the dataset that is being used?
- Many approaches were applied to predict churn in telecom companies. Most of these approaches have used machine learning and data mining.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 -  Telecom company needs to pay attention to the roaming rates. They need to provide good offers to the customers who are using services from a roaming zone.
- Conclusion 2 -  The company needs to focus on the STD and ISD rates. Perhaps, the rates are too high. Provide them with some kind of STD and ISD packages.
- Conclusion 3 -  To look into both of the issues stated above, it is desired that the telecom company collects customer query and complaint data and work on their services according to the needs of customers.
